# Flashcards (Angular + Java SpringBoot)

## Goal

This project goal is to create a software that allows the user to create flashcards using Angular (frontend) and Java with SpringBoot (backend). 
Flashcards are a study method for learning and retaining concepts chosen by the student. 

They consist of a two-sided card. The front contains a question or word, and the back contains the answer.
It's truly powerful with spaced repetition, a method that reinforces concepts over time.
With spaced repetition, short-term memory becomes long-term memory, improving retention.
